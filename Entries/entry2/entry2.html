    <h1 class="main-title">NYC PARK</h1>
    <div class="hover-text-container">
        The second stop
        <span class="tooltip">Nestled within the vibrant pulse of New York City lies a haven of nature and sensory delight: the quintessential city park.<br>
            Imagine the rustle of autumn leaves swirling in the wind, mingling with the playful barks echoing from the dog park nearby.<br>
            The rhythmic gurgle of a central fountain creates a soothing counterpoint to the soft crunch of footsteps on the grass.<br>
            These layered sounds form a symphony of the city—an urban orchestra where nature and humanity intertwine.<br>
            In a metropolis defined by its energy,NYC parks become sanctuaries of sound, where the cacophony of the cityscape transforms<br>
            into moments of connection and calm. This is the City of Sounds, where every park tells its own auditory story, weaving nature’s <br>melody with the rhythm of urban life.
            Enjoy the sounds！</span>

    <h2 class="content">History of the NYC Park</h2>
    <h3 class="content2">The history of New York City's parks is closely tied to the city's development, growth, and the increasing importance placed on public spaces.<br> 
        The idea of parks in the city dates back to the early 19th century when urbanization and industrialization were rapidly changing the landscape of New York.<br> 
        Central Park, the most iconic of NYC's parks, was the first landscaped public park in the United States. Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux,<br> 
        it opened in 1858 and transformed a largely undeveloped area into a 843-acre green space. Central Park was revolutionary in its design, creating a naturalistic<br> 
        environment where city dwellers could escape the congestion and pollution of urban life. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the creation of additional<br> 
        parks continued, with the development of Prospect Park in Brooklyn (designed by Olmsted and Vaux as well) and the creation of smaller parks in neighborhoods<br> 
        across the city. The city’s park system expanded in the 20th century, with the establishment of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park for the 1939 World's Fair and the<br> 
        development of other parks like Riverside Park and Fort Tryon Park. Throughout the years, the city's parks have served as places of recreation, relaxation, and<br> 
        cultural events. They have also been central to social movements and urban revitalization efforts. Today, the New York City Parks Department oversees more than<br> 
        1,700 parks, playgrounds, and recreational facilities, offering green spaces to millions of residents and visitors every year. NYC’s parks continue to evolve,<br> 
        addressing the challenges of urban density, environmental sustainability, and access to nature in one of the most populous cities in the world.<br>
