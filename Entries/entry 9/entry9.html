    <h1 class="main-title">1929</h1>

    <p class="text" id="text">
        During the Great Depression, New York City was hit hard by the economic collapse<br> 
        that swept across the United States. The city, once a booming hub of industry and<br>  
        commerce, saw widespread unemployment, poverty, and homelessness. By 1933, nearly<br>  
        one in four New Yorkers were unemployed, and many were left struggling to survive<br>  
        in a city that seemed to offer no reprieve.<br> 

        The streets of New York were filled with desperate workers and families, many of<br> 
         whom sought aid through soup kitchens and charity organizations. Skyscrapers,<br>  
         symbols of prosperity, loomed over neighborhoods where families were forced into<br>  
         overcrowded tenements or makeshift shantytowns known as “Hoovervilles.” In the<br>  
         face of dire economic conditions, protests and demonstrations became frequent as<br>  
         people demanded jobs, food, and relief.<br> 
        
        Despite the hardships, the Great Depression also spurred significant political and<br> 
        social change in New York City. The election of Fiorello La Guardia as mayor in 1933<br>  
        brought hope for reform, and his leadership helped bring in New Deal programs aimed<br>  
        at creating jobs, building infrastructure, and providing aid to those in need. This<br>  
        period of hardship laid the groundwork for many of the social programs and urban<br>  
        transformations that would shape the city's future.<br> 
        
        New York City during the Great Depression was a place of struggle but also resilience,<br>  
        as the people of the city fought for survival and change in the face of one of the most<br>  
        challenging periods in American history.</p>
