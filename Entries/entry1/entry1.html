      <span class="hover-text2">The history of New York subway musicians dates<br>
        back to the early 20th century, when<br> 
        street performers began to showcase<br> 
        their talents in the subway stations.<br>
        As the subway system expanded, so did<br> 
        the presence of musicians, who often<br>
        performed for tips, turning the transit<br> 
        system into a vibrant cultural space.<br> 
        Over time, the MTA introduced the Music<br> 
        Under New York (MUNY) program in the 1980s,<br> 
        formalizing the role of subway musicians.<br> 
        Today, these performers continue to contribute<br> 
        to the city's dynamic atmosphere, offering<br> 
        everything from classical pieces to modern<br> 
        genres in one of the world’s busiest transit systems.</span>

        The NYC subway is more than just a transportation<br>  
        system;it’s an essential part of the city's daily<br>  
        life and culture With over 470 stations spread<br>  
        across four boroughs,it’s one of the largest and<br>  
        busiest subway networks in the world.People think<br>  
        the subway in various ways—some with nostalgia<br>   
        for its historic charm, others with frustration<br>  
        over delays and overcrowding. But there’s no denying<br>  
        its place as the lifeblood of New York City, carrying<br>  
        millions of passengers each day. From the hum of<br>  
        trains to the street performers in the stations,<br>  
        the subway is as much about the people and the<br>  
        stories they carry as it is about getting from<br> 
        point A to point B.

        In 1965, the MTA was created to consolidate<br>   
        the city’s various transit systems, including<br>   
        the subway, bus services, and commuter rails,<br>   
        under one governing body. The subway system<br>   
        continued to expand and modernize throughout<br>   
        the 20th century, with new lines added and older<br>   
        trains replaced. Major upgrades in the 1980s and<br>   
        1990s, such as the introduction of newer,<br>   
        air-conditioned trains, improved signaling,<br>   
        and extensive track repairs, marked a <br>  
        revitalization period for the subway system.</span>

        In 2023, the Metropolitan MTA<br> 
        reported a significant increase in<br>  
        ridership across its services.<br>  
        Subway ridership reached 1.15 billion<br>  
        annual paid rides, marking<br>  
        a 14% rise from the previous year and<br>  
        achieving the billion-ride<br>  
        milestone six weeks earlier than in 2022.<br>  
        Metro-North Railroad saw a 23% increase,<br>  
        with annual rail ridership totaling 60.1 million.<br>

        25.7 million customers,<br>
