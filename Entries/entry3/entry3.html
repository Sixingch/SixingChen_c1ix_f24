        <span class="tooltip">New York City streets are a relentless clash of noise—car horns blaring, 
            <BR>brakes screeching, and voices colliding in an endless hum. Footsteps pound the pavement 
            <br>as street vendors shout, and the wind rustles trash in alleys. Sirens wail in the distance, 
            <br>cutting through the chaos. Here, sound isn’t ambiance—it’s aggression, a constant reminder 
            <br>of the city’s restless energy.</span>

                Bicycles first became popular in New York City<br>
                in the late 19th century, with a cycling craze in<br> 
                the 1890s that led to the creation of bike lanes.<br> 
                However, the rise of automobiles in the 20th century<br> 
                led to a decline in cycling. In the late 20th and early<br> 
                21st centuries, bicycles made a strong comeback, driven<br> 
                by a focus on sustainability and fitness. The launch of<br> 
                the Citi Bike program in 2009 marked a significant moment<br> 
                in this resurgence. Today, bikes are an integral part of<br> 
                NYC’s transportation system, supported by an expanding network<br> 
                of bike lanes and rental programs.</span>

            <span class="hover-text2">
                The crosswalk button in New York City was introduced in<br> 
                the mid-20th century, allowing pedestrians to control when<br>  
                to cross the street by activating traffic signals. While<br>  
                initially a key safety feature, many buttons became redundant<br>  
                with the development of automated traffic systems. Despite this,<br>  
                they remain common in the city, though modern updates are<br>  
                gradually replacing some of the older systems with automated<br>  
                solutions. The button symbolizes New York's effort to manage<br>  
                pedestrian and traffic flow in a busy urban environment.</span>

                An interesting story in New York City's car history is the<br>  
                Great Depression Traffic Jam of 1930. A routine breakdown<br> 
                led to a massive traffic gridlock that spilled onto the Brooklyn Bridge,<br>  
                causing hours of chaos. This incident highlighted the city's struggle<br>  
                to accommodate the growing number of cars and underscored the need<br>  
                for better infrastructure. It marked the beginning of efforts to<br>  
                expand roadways and improve traffic management in the face of<br>  
                New York's automobile boom.</span>

As of 2023, New York City's population is approximately 8.26 million people,<br>   
making it the most populous city in the United States. While the city has<br>   
seen a slight decline in population in recent years due to factors like high<br>   
living costs and the rise of remote work, it continues to be a global hub of<br>   
culture, finance, and diversity. With its dynamic neighborhoods and<br>   
ever-evolving landscape, NYC remains a vital center for commerce, innovation,<br>   
and international influence.</span>

The New York Police Department (NYPD) is the largest municipal police<br>    
force in the United States, responsible for maintaining law and order<br>    
across New York City. Established in 1845, the NYPD has a rich history<br>    
of policing one of the world’s most diverse and populous cities.<br>    
It plays a crucial role in crime prevention, investigation, and<br>    
community safety, with a wide range of specialized units, including<br>    
counterterrorism and traffic enforcement. Known for its iconic uniform<br>    
and significant presence in the city, the NYPD is an integral part of<br>    
New York’s identity and daily life.</span>
