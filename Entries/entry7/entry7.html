                <span class="hover-text2">
                    The origin of milk tea is commonly traced to Taiwan in the 1980s,<br> 
                    where it first became popular in the form of bubble tea (also known as boba tea).<br>
                    The drink was created by combining sweetened tea with milk and adding chewy<br> 
                    tapioca pearls. The iconic bubble tea became a sensation in Taiwan and quickly<br> 
                    spread to other parts of Asia and the world.<br>
                    However, the concept of milk tea itself predates bubble tea and can be found<br> 
                    in various cultures. For example, in Hong Kong, the "Hong Kong-style milk tea"<br> 
                    has been a staple since the 1950s, made with strong black tea and evaporated or<br> 
                    condensed milk. Similarly, in mainland China, milk tea is enjoyed in different<br> 
                    regional forms, often combining traditional tea with milk for a smoother, richer flavor.</span>

                <span class="hover-text2">
                    The erhu is a traditional Chinese stringed instrument, often referred to as the<br>  
                    "Chinese violin." It consists of two strings, typically tuned a fifth apart, and<br>  
                    is played with a bow that is placed between the strings. The erhu's distinct,<br>  
                    expressive sound is produced by drawing the bow across the strings while pressing<br> 
                    them with the fingers on the fingerboard. With its melancholic, yet deeply emotional<br>  
                    tone, the erhu is a key instrument in both classical Chinese music and modern<br>  
                    compositions, often used to evoke a wide range of emotions in performances.<br>  
                    It is a symbol of China's rich musical heritage and continues to captivate audiences<br>  
                    around the world.</span>
