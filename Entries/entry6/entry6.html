        K-Town in New York City is filled with a diverse array of sounds<br>  
        that reflect its lively, multicultural atmosphere. You’ll often<br>  
        hear the rhythmic hum of bustling crowds, especially during the<br>  
        evening hours when the streets come alive with people visiting<br>  
        restaurants, karaoke bars, and shops. The clatter of chopsticks<br>  
        and sizzling sounds from Korean BBQ restaurants, where meats are<br>  
        grilled at the table, adds to the vibrant soundscape.</div>
